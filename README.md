Submission to the GMTK 2025 game jam
Theme: Loop

This game is a short memory game where you try to remember as many alien words as you can!

# Game Description
Welcome to your first day at Galactech Inc.!

You've made it! But...

Yikes. These aliens sure do love their corporate jargon. To get through training, you'll have to do your best to remember all those words. Lucky for you, your supervisor is lenient (enough) and will understand if it's your first time hearing some terms so get some notes down! However, you will be expected to listen intently for the rest of the training period.

Don't get caught slacking, and do your best to STAY IN THE LOOP!

How to play:

As your alien supervisor gives his dastardly list of vocabulary, you'll have until each whistle count to decide whether or not the word that appears is new or old. You'll need to remember as many words as you can!
-  for new words, right click 
-  for old words, left click

There are no takebacks!!!
If you fail to make a clear decision before time ends or  choose incorrectly, you'll gain a strike.Three strikes and it'll be the end of your career...
Good luck!
